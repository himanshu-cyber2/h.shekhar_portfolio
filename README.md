H.SHEKHAR | Digital Architect Portfolio

A high-performance, visually immersive portfolio website designed with an "Ice-Carbon" aesthetic. This project showcases a blend of creative frontend engineering, 3D simulations, and interactive logic modules.

🚀 Live Modules

1. Quantum Ledger (Expense Tracker)

A financial intelligence module that allows users to track expenditures.

Features: Real-time data visualization using Chart.js, persistent session logging, and category-based breakdown.

Logic: Implements a functional data-store and dynamic doughnut chart updates.

2. AIRA Typo Engine

A neural input simulation (typing game) designed to test user speed and accuracy.

Features: 30-second countdown, real-time WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation, and accuracy tracking.

Interactions: Custom keyboard event listeners with visual feedback for correct/incorrect inputs.

3. Logical Conflict Resolver (RPS)

An interactive implementation of Rock Paper Scissors.

Features: Score tracking and randomized computer logic.

Design: Minimalist icon-based UI with glowing state transitions.

🛠 Tech Stack

Core: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables & Clip-paths)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

3D Graphics: Three.js (Icosahedron geometry & Grid helpers)

Animations: GSAP (ScrollTrigger & Tweening)

Data Viz: Chart.js

Icons: Font Awesome 6

Typography: Sora, Plus Jakarta Sans, and JetBrains Mono (via Google Fonts)

🎨 Architectural Design

The portfolio follows a "Digital Architect" theme:

Perspective Background: A Three.js scene that responds to mouse movement, creating a parallax 3D depth effect.

Glassmorphism: High-blur backdrops and semi-transparent borders to simulate frosted glass.

Cyber-Industrial UI: Heavy use of monospace fonts, "SYS" labels, and clip-path polygon geometries for a futuristic feel.

🖥️ Getting Started

Clone the project:

git clone [repository-url]


Launch:
Since this is a single-file architecture, simply open portfolio.html in any modern web browser. No build steps or dependencies are required as all libraries are loaded via CDN.
